                    <p>Digital videos are made by converting each pixel’s color into 8-bit binary numbers. These bits are combined frame by frame to form a continuous binary stream. This process, though simple in concept, is how videos are stored and transmitted across devices, explaining the foundation of modern digital video technology.</p>
